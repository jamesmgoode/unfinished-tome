    <h2>Beastkin</h2>
    <p>
      Beastkin are often instinctive; they make snap judgements and then swiftly
      pursue them rather than slowing down and planning ahead. While this can
      certainly be a weakness there are many jobs where it is a distinct
      advantage. Many beastkin take work as guides, bodyguards and trackers,
      where instinctive action can be make or break for survival. It would be a
      mistake to think that beastkin are simple and they can find success in
      many walks of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beastkin are often imbued with characteristics of their animal heritage
      (owls are wise, wolves stalk their prey etc) and retain a link back to
      their inner animal.
